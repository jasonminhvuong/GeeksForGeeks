"""
    You are in a party of N people, where only one person is known to everyone.
    Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesnâ€™t know
    anyone in the party. Your task is to find the stranger (celebrity) in
    party.
    You will be given a square matrix M[][] where if an element of row i and
    column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to
    complete the function getId() which finds the id of the celebrity if
    present else return -1. The function getId() takes two arguments, the
    square matrix M and its size N.

    Note: Expected time complexity is O(N) with constant extra space.

    User Task:
    The task is to complete the function getId() which returns the Id of 
    celebrity if present, else -1.
