"""
    Given an unsorted array of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from
    set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array.
    Find these two numbers.

    Note: If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found.
    Also, expected solution is O(n) time and constant extra space.

    Input:
    The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test
    cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test
    case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second
    line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the
    elements of the array.

    Output:
    Print B, the repeating number followed by A which is missing in a single
    line.
